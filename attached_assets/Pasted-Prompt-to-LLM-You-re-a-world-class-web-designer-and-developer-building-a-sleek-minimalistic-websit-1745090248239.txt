Prompt to LLM:
You’re a world-class web designer and developer building a sleek, minimalistic website for Echo Noir, an AI-powered answering service for small businesses. The style is similar to Apple.com—clean typography, rich 4-8k imagery, subtle animations, and intuitive interactivity. The primary font for the brand name is “LoosExtended Medium” for “Echo” and “LoosExtended Light” for “Noir.” The color palette is predominantly dark (near-black background) with vibrant orange (#FF4E2E) accent colors. Include subtle geometric orange shapes as decorative elements for visual contrast. Parallax scrolling animations and interactive card-flip elements are key engagement features.
